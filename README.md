# App Development
Apps I developed for fun using MIT App Inventor in 2018

I cannot guarantee that all of these apps will continue to work, as I am not actively maintaining them

<br>

**App Updater:** This app allows you to see when I update my apps, and makes their install process simple.
 
**Chat for Android:** A group chat application. Start a group and have all of your friends join for a real-time chat.

**Emoji Translator:** Ever wanted to text your friends in emojis? Now you can! Simply input text to translate to emoji. Now includes reverse translate!

**GPA Calculator:** A fast and easy way to find out your GPA! Input your grades and watch your GPA change in real time. Wonder what would happen if you get a B+ instead of a B? You're only a few taps away from finding out how it impacts your average. This app was my submission for the 2018 CSP Create Task. (This one is the one called file.apk, App Inventor doesn't let you rename projects.)

**Inventory Tracker:** This app lets you add and remove items form your personal inventory. Then you can check them in and out and set due dates for them. The added barcode scanner allows you to easily search for items.

**Codes & Ciphers:** Communicate in secret with this app. Currently features Morse Code and Caesar Cipher. This was my Create #1 Task submission. (This is the file named MorseCodeGenerator.apk.) This app has been depreciated, but the latest version is still available for download. This app has been replaced by Cipher Share (see below)

**Cipher Share:** Create and share ciphers. Communicate in secret or send silly messages with this awesome app. Pre-provided ciphers include Morse Code, Text to Leet, and Swap Vowels.    .--. .-. . - - -.--  -.-. --- --- .-.. --..--  .-. .. --. .... - ..--..

**Paint Pot:** A spin off of the original Paint Pot app. Add text to your images, take pictures, and even save images after you close the app. (Named PaintPotWithProcedure.apk)

**Custom Search Engine:** Like a real web crawler, Custom Search Engine follows links on the sites you specify and indexes the pages it finds. Build up your search engine, adding sites to your index and excluding the sites you don't want to see. Then, you can search your index for the sites you've included. (Named searchEngine.apk)

**Quiz App:** A spin off of the Computer Principles Quiz App, Quiz App allows users to create and share their own quizzes and play other users' quizzes.

**Note App:** Stuck with an awful note taking app on your phone? Want a better, simpler experience, one geared toward elegance and practicality? Introducing Note App! Note App allows users to take notes, create drawings, and even make recordings without interrupting the creative thought process as most note taking apps do. Creating notes, drawings, and recordings is an easy process that saves users time so they don't forget that burst of inspiration they just had.
